# Land-Area-Measurement-Application-
This project, created for my final year, allows users to measure land areas on an interactive map, convert units, and access government resources for farmers. It was well received and earned high marks for its functionality. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and PHP.
